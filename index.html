    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Aalto University, and my main interests are in the field of harmonic analysis.
        Before joining Aalto, I completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Bologna.
        During my Master's studies, I spent one semester at the University of Helsinki as an Erasmus student, and later I spent three months 
        visiting Aalto University to work on part of my master's thesis. These experiences helped shape my academic 
        interests and eventually led me to start my doctoral studies here.
    </p>

    <p>
        My main research focus is harmonic analysis, but I am broadly interested in 
        many areas of mathematical analysis. As a student, I also enjoyed courses in algebra and geometry, even though 
        I eventually chose to specialize in analysis—mainly because harmonic analysis was the field that resonated 
        with me the most and captured my curiosity.
    </p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Harmonic analysis</li>
        <li>Singular/Fractional integral operators</li>
        <li>Commutators</li>
        <li>Analysis on spaces of homogeneous type</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Publications</h2>
    <p>
        As of today, I have not yet published any scientific articles. 
        However, I anticipate that this will happen fairly soon, and these articles will then be listed in this section.
    <p>

    <h2>A Bit More About Me</h2>
    <p>
    Outside mathematics, I have a wide range of interests. Motorsport — especially Formula 1 — is one of them, but it is
    really just one example of a broader pattern: I regularly go through periods where I become intensely curious about a 
    specific topic and start exploring it as much as I can. Of course, I only dive into these subjects at a superficial 
    level, since it is impossible to study everything as deeply as mathematics, which is my actual work, but I genuinely 
    enjoy learning whatever is accessible to me.
    Over the years, this curiosity has led me to explore fields such as geography, vexillology (the study of flags), 
    aviation, history, geopolitics, music, art, a variety of sports, and many others.
